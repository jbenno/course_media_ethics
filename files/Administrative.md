# Administrative Matters

## 1. Communication
- Please use email for communicating with me.
- **Please always put the course title into the subject line!**

## 2. Assignments
- Reading and watching the provided material is required in advance for each class.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class.
- Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- You find the assignments on Canvas. For your overview on the weekly structure, you may also see the spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PF90ODBUYyMH6rCboMrSOhyd54RS3lr8WP_D86ORwR8/edit?usp=sharing
- Please submitt your assigned work via Canvas unless stated otherwise.
- The assignments are due at the date that shows in Canvas. Submitting late will reduce the grade of the assignment by one point.
- The readings and other media assigned in Canvas are mandatory. Unless stated otherwise, pdf files for the readings can be found in this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xQenARalQSsy0JzQP-68V1wXmVrIHbpV?usp=sharing
- Generally you will have a full week to complete an assignment. You are expected to start the assignment in time. Sending in questions for clarification on the day before the assignment will generally not be sufficient. 

## 3. Attendance
- Your attendance in person is expected. If you are sick, you have another important cause preventing you from attending, please send your request to be excused via email.
- In general, more than one unexcused absence will result in reducing the final grade by one half grade.
- In general, more than three absences in total will result in failing class. In this case, you may ask for an *incomplete* grade.
- You are expected to be in the classroom on time. If you are late, your might be noted as absent.

## 4. Participation
- You are expected to participate in class discussions and group assignments.
- You may use electronic devices to take notes or when explicitly asked to do so. Please be considerate and don't waste your time by sitting in class while doing other things on your devices.
- Mobile phones have to be silenced during class time.
- Using social media during class time is not acceptable.

## 5. Grades
*Work in progress*

## Other matters
Please refer to the general rules and guidelines of the college, in particular the Student Handbook.
